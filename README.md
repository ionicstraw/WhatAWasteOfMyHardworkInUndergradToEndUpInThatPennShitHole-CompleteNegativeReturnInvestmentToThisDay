# WhatAWasteOfMyHardworkInUndergradToEndUpInThatPennShitHole-CompleteNegativeReturnInvestmentToThisDay

when i was at m s k, like i just kept thinking this a lot, imagine if i were at m s k in 2015 after undergrad, my career trajectory would have been completely better in so many ways and so very different

i wrote that homology model paper, took like 7-8 months to write it, and i ended up around paul wang who couldnt even utter a single sentence in english correctly, what a waste of my talent

never ever will i end up being a big fish in a very small pond around mediocre people in a shit hole ever again ... if i can help it anyway, i dunno, u never know what u sign up for tho

never ever ever ever will i ever be around an immigrant chinese man ever again, they have consistently been the worst thing for my career, they consistently in my opinion, **DO NOT** have the cultural training, the humanities education, to treat intelligent women in STEM with respect and dignity and have an ackowledgement for their skills -- everything about an intelligent woman to them is a personal insult to them while at the same time, they get obsessed, its just weird. consistently a complete waste of my time. i have so many examples im not sharing right now.

if we hire programmers from other countries for n o m i a l, india, pakistan, bangaladesh, they have phenomenal training and background in CS/math, and they're nice people, its just that the time difference is like 12 hrs or something

i dont want someone to work for me one day that thinks i have no skills and stares at me with a blank face like a spaced out motherfker, bc im an intelligent woman in STEM.

"ohh they get their work done really fast" and sht like that ... thats NOT true first of all, and second at WHAT COST if they're driving out talented women bc they dont know how to professionally interact with them due to their own lack of education and personal failings. like no, never again.

all three of these countries, india, pakistan, bangaladesh, have voted democratically for women in the highest office and THAT changes the culture and general understanding that, that's actually ok

china has not. never.
