# WhatAWasteOfMyHardworkInUndergradToEndUpInThatPennShitHole-CompleteNegativeReturnInvestmentToThisDay

when i was at m s k, like i just kept thinking this a lot, imagine if i were at m s k in 2015 after undergrad, my career trajectory would have been completely better in so many ways and so very different

i wrote that homology model paper, took like 7-8 months to write it, and i ended up around paul wang who couldnt even utter a single sentence in english correctly, what a waste of my talent

never ever will i end up being a big fish in a very small pond around mediocre people in a shit hole ever again ... if i can help it anyway, i dunno, u never know what u sign up for tho
