# WhatAWasteOfMyHardworkInUndergradToEndUpInThatPennShitHole-CompleteNegativeReturnInvestmentToThisDay

when i was at m s k, like i just kept thinking this a lot, imagine if i were at m s k in 2015 after undergrad, my career trajectory would have been completely better in so many ways and so very different

i wrote that homology model paper, took like 7-8 months to write it, and i ended up around paul wang who couldnt even utter a single sentence in english correctly, what a waste of my talent

never ever will i end up being a big fish in a very small pond around mediocre people in a shit hole ever again ... if i can help it anyway, i dunno, u never know what u sign up for tho

never ever ever ever will i ever be around an immigrant chinese man ever again, they have consistently been the worst thing for my career, they consistently in my opinion, **DO NOT** have the cultural training, the humanities education, to treat intelligent women in STEM with respect and dignity and have an ackowledgement for their skills -- everything about an intelligent woman to them is a personal insult to them while at the same time, they get obsessed, its just weird. consistently a complete waste of my time. i have so many examples im not sharing right now.

if we hire programmers from other countries for n o m i a l, india, pakistan, they have phenomenal training and background in CS/math, and they're nice people, its just that the time difference is like 12 hrs or something
